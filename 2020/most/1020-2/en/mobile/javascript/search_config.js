Application such as environmental monitoring and information network, intelligent transportation system, 3D geographic coordinate system, public equipment management, monitoring and integration system, intelligent disaster prevention system, and industrial wastewater management system are implemented in conjunction with trendy technologies including Big Data, IoT, and cloud computing. These facilities can foster energy and water saving, carbon and waste reduction, efficient transportation and traffic safety, thus creating a convenient living space and an ideal entrepreneurial environment with strong competitiveness for attracting invest- ment.\nTo establish a low-carbon green-energy environment, science parks not only bring renewable energy opera- tors, but also promote the installation of solar photovoltaics on public roofs and set up demonstration sites of distributed power systems (with energy storage systems). Water reclamation plants are also set up for water recy- cle so as to diversify water sources and ensure stable supply. Automatic wastewater treatment is carried out for environmental protection. Air-quality monitoring systems are also installed for prompt warnings on environmental quality. Such information would be included in the smart park database to be processed using big data analytics for intelligence science park environmental management.\n"];
